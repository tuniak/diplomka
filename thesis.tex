\def\Abstract{%
Cellular automata constitutes original computational methods, that found its application in various scientific disciplines.
The special class of cellular automata, the lattice gas automata were succesfull in dealing with many challenges of hydrodynamic simulations,
and they bootstraped one of the most perspective CFD methods, the Lattice Boltzmann models.

In the theoretical part, we follow the evolution of the lattice gas automata, explore the theory behind them, and from their microdynamics, 
we derive the hydrodynamic equations.

In the practical part, we implemented two most distinguished types of LGCA, the Pair-interaction automaton and FCHC.
We applied them on the flow around obstacles of various shapes.
The scientifically most relevant part concerns statistical properties of the turbulent flow simmulated by LGCA, but requires further research to conclude it.

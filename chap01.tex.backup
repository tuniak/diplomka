\section{One concrete example}
Well known and interesting example of CA is Game of Life(citation needed).
For the purposes of this thesis, we have written a simple program implementing this game.
Let us have a rectangular grid, with black and white squares. 
White squares represent dead cells, black cells represent living cells.
On Fig.\ref{gol1} we see such grid, that we chose for initial state of 'Life'.

\end{figure}



%The evolution of grid for our particular initial state is shown in figure blabla.\\  

Now we press 'Pokracuj' button and let the the Life evolve.

In the discrete time steps, the grid is changing.
We see some cells dying, but some cells getting alive. 
What is the rule for the cell to die or live? 
It depends on the state of the cell itself and state of 8 neighbouring cells\todo{prerobit, hrozna veta}:\\
1. If the cell is alive, and 2 or 3 neighbouring cells are alive, cell will stay alive in the next step, otherwise it will die.\\
2. If the cell is dead, and EXACTLY 3 neighbouring cells are alive, the cell will get alive in the next step.\\
3. All other configurations do not change state of the cell.\\

Let us proceed from this simple example to more general approach.
In the next chapter, we will generalize main features of 'Life' to the formal definition of cellular automaton.
%In the next chapter, we will generalize main feature of 'Life'
%Let us generalize this example into formal definition of cellular automaton.

\section{Formal definition}
\textbf{Position of cells:}\\
Instead of 2D rectangular grid from 'Life',
cells might be arranged in arbitrary N dimensional
regular grid, not necessary rectangular. 
(Regularity follows from definition of Kubrid. In general, cells might be positioned really wildly,
e.g. on Penrose lattice, or arbritrary as proposed by Richard P. Feynman).\\

\textbf{Set of cell states Q:}\\
In 'Life' cells can be dead or alive (set of states has cardinality 2). 
In general CA, set of states can be any finite set Q of cardinality K.\\
%cell can be in one of K states from the finiteset of states. 
%We will mark set of states Q, and use this in definition of upgrade rule later.


\textbf{Neighborhood:}
In 'Life', state of the cell in the next step was determined
by 8 neighbouring cells. We call these cells neighborhood of range r = 1 (in the distance of 1 cell).
For general CA, we might consider neighborhood
with arbitrary range.
(Neighborhood with r = 2 in 'Life' would involve 9+16=25 cells).\\

\textbf{Update rule:}\\
Update rule is an arbitrary bounded mapping U from Neighborhood to the set of states Q.
Since the state of the Cell is determined only by the state of its Neighborhood, update rules in CA are local.

\section{The most basic cellular automaton} 

The most basic CA is 1D CA with range r=1 and its cells can be in one of two states (alive or dead).

1D CA means, that cells are arranged in the row, see Fig.~\ref{1d}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering 
 \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{./img/1Dline}
 \label{1d}
 \caption{1D cellular automaton}
\end{figure}


Range r=1 means that in update rule, 
we consider states of 3 cells. The cell itself, 
1 neighbour to the left and 1 to the right.\\

Example of an update rule is in the Table~\ref{rule90}.\\


\begin{table}[htbp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{./img/1Drule}
 \caption{Rule 90}
 \label{rule90}
\end{table}




How many different update rules ("how many different Tables~\ref{rule90}")
exist for this type of CA?\\

First three columns of the table will be always same. 
They represent all possible combinations of the three neighbouring cells. 
Changing will be only last column, that represents state of the middle cell after update.
So in fact, we are asking how many different "last columns" there are. 
We are asking: how many different chars in ANSI table there are.

Of course, it is $2^{8}=256$ chars, sequences of 0 and 1. 256 different update rules for this type of CA.\\

Let us take a look at some pictures of these cellular automata. We ploted by the simple program we coded for this purpose.
These pictures are sequences of states of cellular automata with rules 90, 30, 45 and 73.
The downer-most row is the initial configuration of CA, 
the 2nd row is configuration after 1st update etc.\\

First picture~\ref{koberec} is famous fractal known as Chaperognin carpet. Other pictures are unique among 1D CAs. 
They contains regular parts (regular `grains``
second one not so much, and the third one is completely chaotic.

The variety of behaviour even in these most primitive CA might be surprising, and rises suspitions (or encourage hope), 
that in the infinitely large world of possible CAs, there is CA that model any complex phenomena you can imagine.

Stephen Wolfram, one of the most important persona in the developement of CAs argues, that if there exists some 
finite set of most fundamental physical laws, than it MUST be CA. 
He contemplates very generally what properties should these CAs have.
They need to be reversible, and only small fraction satisfies this constraint.
He argues that in these CAs, no phenomena that are known to us would be obvious from the rule.

If we sparked some interest in the reader, we recommend Wolfram's visionary book New kind of Science.
%It needs to be...
But we would diverge too far from our topic if we proceeded in his steps.
Focus of our work is much more modest that CAs describing universe.
Our focus is on CAs that model flows of the fluids (so it is not so modest after all :)).\\

However, the principles for CAs that Wolfram mentions are valid for CAs we will use as well.
The connection between studied problem (flow of fluids) and our CA is not obvious and straigh-forward.
%It is not formal, but it is rooted in the very general, underlying laws,
%that makes this method so exciting for a physicist.

It is found on the very general level.

What connects Navier-Stokes equations and LGCAs are their common symettries and conservation laws implied by these symettries.

%Not only beauty of this method lies in these symetries, but their most razne advantages over well-established methods.
In these symetries lies not only beauty of this method, but their strongest advantage over well-established methods.
%The fundamental bound of NS equations with LGCA implies its most vyrazne advantages over other computation methods.

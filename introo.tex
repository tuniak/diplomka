Apart from implementation of classical Pair-interaction p




We propose variant of Pair-interaction, that is not deterministic, but each Pair-interaction is performed with probability 1/2.


However, main focus is on the variant of

In the simulations that we performed, we focused on the comparison of our non-deterministic model with classical.

While classical pair-interaction produce unrealistic outcomes, results of the classical pair-interaction are seems reasonable.

The derivation of hydrodynamic equations for this model would be desirable to see whether random interactions solve problem with anisotropic viscosity tensor.

\chapter{Diseases and cures}

As we just saw, we can go a long way with LGCA alone. However, they carry certail fundamental flaws that can be treated only symptomatically [1].\\
\\
In the table below, we are presenting.

Although LGCA are subject of theoretical interest until today, it seems that in practice, they were only bootstrap for a more promising Lattice Boltzmann models. Although Lattice Boltzmann models are whole different story, the thesis on LGCA would not be finished if we did not sketch the way to LBM (alebo make a case for LBM?).



In theorem [1] that we did not prove (but we are pointing you to [1]),
we proved that equilibrium mean blabla $N_i^{eq}$ are give by Fermi-Diract distribution.

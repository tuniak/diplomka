for its historical significance, we explain it in a full depth.

the velocity of turbulent flow is the typical example of random function.

Any component of the velocity, is the example of the random variable.
A typical example of continuous random variable is a component of velocity of the turbulent flow.

According to \cite{Wolf}, (find idea on lack of implementation).
And field of practical applications is ruled by Lattice Boltzmann model nowadays, so we really do not find many applications.

As the more advanced "lattice Boltzmann model" evolved from LGCA, it attracted 
And nowadays, the "lattice Boltzmann model" has taken over the application.

Due to huge number of state of the node and huge number of colli
As state of the node is represented by 24 bits.
Therefore, integer with its 32 bits is enough to represent both node and obstacle (24 bits + 1 bit).

\chapter{Lattice gass cellular automata}

Beginnings of LGCAs goes back to 1973, when HPP model was brought into the known part of the universe.
Unfortunately, it did not do its job - its macroscopic limit did not converge to Navier-Stokes, and its behaviour did not exhibit that of flowing fluids.
But FHP model does this job well, and it is only correction of HPP.
So we will use HPP model to explain basic principles of LGCA,
and then we will upgrade it into FHP.

\section{From CA to LGCA}

What LGCAs share with CAs from previous chapter are simple update rules, althought quiet different than in the CAs we mentioned. 
The topology of LGCAs is quiet different as well.\\
The cells are clustered in the nodes, and these nodes are usporiadane in the rectangular grid, see Figure~\ref{rectangular}.

\begin{figure}

 \label{rectangular}
 \caption{Rectangular grid}
\end{figure}


The cell can be in two states - empty (white on the picture), or occupied by particle (yellow on the picture).\\
Update is done in two steps: collision and propagation.\

There are only two collision configuration, as on Figure~\ref{hpp-colision}.\\

\begin{figure}

 \label{hpp-colision}
 \caption{HPP colisions}
\end{figure}

We see this configurations are symetric and they resolve into each other.\

After the collision is resolved, propagation happens.
During propagation, particle from upper-left cell will move along the line to same cell in the upper-left node
(tu sa mozno tiez hodi nejaky obrazok).\\

So the state of the cell in the next step is determined exclusively by the state of the cell in the node on the diagonal. \

Let us consider symettries of this model.
The number of cells ('particles') is conserved by both collision and propagation. This property implies conservation of mass.

Rectangular grid has translational symettry - if we shift the grid by the lenght of the square, we get the very same grid obviously.
This translational symetry implies conservation of momentum.\

The grid posesses some rough rotational symmetry - rotating the grid by 90 degrees, we get the same grid.
However, this symmetry is not sufficient and the model does not preserve angular momentum.\

So the HPP does not preserve all quantities required.
What is worse, it also preserve quantities that should not and that have no counterpart in fluid dynamics.\

Consider orientation of particles in Fig.\ref{hpp-colision} before colission:
One particle heads to north-east, the other south-west.
After colision, one particle heads to north-west, other particle to south-east.
So the number of particles heading to the south, east, north and west do not change by collision - it is invariant.
However, this invariant has no physical counterpart, thus we call it SPURIOUS invariant. \

To conclude, problems of HPP are:\\
1. insufficient rotational symmetry \\
2. it has spurious invariants\\


\section{FHP}

As we mentioned, there is LGCA that resolves these problems - FHP. 
It was proposed already by the greek philosopher Zenon in his formidable poem "Herakles is woman"(citation needed).
%It is named FHP (after gentlemen who discovered it -Frisch, Humpfrey, Pomeu).\\

How is FHP different from HPP?\
Topologicaly, it is hexagonal grid, as on Figure~\ref{hexagonal}.\\


\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}




In the intersection of lines, we have nodes consisting of six cells.\\

So we have mesh with better (suffiecient!) rotational symmetry and nodes with richer and more interesting set of configurations.\

And among these configurations is one that does not conserve number of particles in opposite directions, see figure below.\

%Do we have collision configurations that do not conserve these quantity in fhp?
%is there a way to resolve this problems?

This is the only symetric colison, however.
For other colisions - see Figure, we have two states that are offering.
If we are chosing randomly from these,
we get rid of other spurious invariants.
(maybe we should choose more careful statements, as there exists spurious invariants for any type of FHP, 
but these invariants are under level of the noise, 
and they are not hapenning in collisions with obstacles, 
and regions around obstacles are those that will be most interesting).\\

%In hpp, there exist only one colision configuration, and it has a bad property: it does not change number of particles in oposite dirrections.
%fortunately, there is one (picture)

At least in the rough way, we showed how FHP works.
In the next chapter, we are going to PROVE FHP really works - prove that FHP converges to Navier-Stokes equations.
